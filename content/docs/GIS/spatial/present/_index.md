### Version 1: **Structured and Detailed Presentation**

---

**Good morning everyone,**

Thank you for being here. Today, I’ll be presenting the work of Group 3b, titled “Mapping Crop Suitability Changes in Denmark as a Result of Climate Change.” My teammates are Jip van Groenewoud, Fanny Ningrum, Annika Robben, and Xiaolu Yan. Our research focuses on understanding how climate change affects the suitability of key crops in Denmark, particularly winter wheat and barley, and how Danish farmers can build climate-resilient agriculture.

Let’s begin with the **Introduction**. Denmark is one of the most intensively cultivated countries in Europe, with agricultural land covering about 62% of its total area. Crops like wheat and barley are not only vital for the food supply but also contribute significantly to export revenue. However, climate change is altering this landscape. Shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns are threatening the productivity and sustainability of these crops. Our research aimed to anticipate these changes and propose adaptive strategies to ensure food security and economic stability.

The **Research Questions** guiding our study were:
1. How do projected changes in climatic conditions and soil characteristics affect the suitability of winter wheat and barley in Denmark under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios?
2. How can Danish farmers build climate-resilient agriculture?

To answer these questions, we developed a **Methodology** that involved mapping crop suitability from 1971 to 2020 and projecting future suitability for four time periods: 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100. We used Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 to model different climate scenarios. Additionally, we incorporated soil parameters like pH, salinity, and light intensity to enhance the accuracy of our agricultural model.

Now, let’s discuss the **Results**.
- Figure 4 shows that barley adapts better to diverse soils, particularly in sandy, low-nutrient areas, which are common in western Denmark. Wheat, on the other hand, prefers nutrient-rich soils, found mainly in the east.
- Our research revealed that temperature is the primary factor influencing future crop suitability. Under both RCP scenarios, higher temperatures improved growth conditions for both wheat and barley.
- The RCP 8.5 scenario predicts higher overall suitability compared to RCP 2.6, as seen in Figure 6. However, sandy areas are expected to face nutrient loss due to increased precipitation, which could impact wheat, which thrives in nutrient-rich environments.

In the **Discussion & Conclusion**, we found that while barley is currently more adaptable, long-term productivity will require strategic soil management. For instance, crop rotations with legumes, such as runner beans, can mitigate nutrient loss and soil acidification. Additionally, practices like cover cropping, no-till farming, and optimized ploughing strategies can enhance climate resilience.

Our **Recommendations** include:
1. Developing an improved agricultural model that incorporates additional parameters like pH, light intensity, and salinity.
2. Consulting local farmers to integrate their expertise and address their concerns, ensuring that advice is contextually relevant.
3. Conducting in-depth research to evaluate the feasibility of cultivating crops for the EAT-Lancet diet in Denmark.

In conclusion, our research highlights the importance of proactive adaptation strategies to ensure the sustainability of Denmark’s agricultural sector. By improving soil health and implementing resilient farming practices, Danish farmers can mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.

Thank you for your attention. I’ll now open the floor for questions.

### Version 2: **Concise and Focused Presentation**

**Hello everyone,**

Today, I’ll present the findings of Group 3b on “Mapping Crop Suitability Changes in Denmark as a Result of Climate Change.” Our group includes Jip van Groenewoud, Fanny Ningrum, Annika Robben, and Xiaolu Yan.

Denmark is one of Europe’s most intensively cultivated countries, with 62% of its land used for agriculture. Key crops like wheat and barley are vital for food supply and export revenue. However, climate change—through shifting temperatures and precipitation—threatens the productivity of these crops. Our research aimed to anticipate these changes and propose adaptive strategies.

We focused on two **Research Questions**:
1. How do projected climatic and soil changes affect the suitability of winter wheat and barley in Denmark under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios?
2. How can Danish farmers build climate-resilient agriculture?

Our **Methods** included mapping crop suitability from 1971 to 2020 and projecting future suitability for four time periods using RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios. We also incorporated soil parameters like pH and salinity to improve model accuracy.

Here are the key **Results**:
- Figure 4 shows that barley adapts better to sandy, low-nutrient soils in western Denmark, while wheat thrives in nutrient-rich soils in the east.
- Temperature is the primary driver of future suitability, with higher temperatures improving growth conditions under both RCP scenarios (Figure 5).
- RCP 8.5 predicts higher overall suitability, but sandy areas may face nutrient loss due to increased precipitation (Figure 6).

In our **Discussion & Conclusion**, we found that barley is currently more adaptable, but soil management strategies—like legume crop rotations—are essential for long-term productivity. Practices such as cover cropping and no-till farming can enhance climate resilience.

Our **Recommendations** include:
1. Developing an improved agricultural model with additional parameters.
2. Consulting local farmers to integrate their expertise.
3. Evaluating the feasibility of cultivating crops for the EAT-Lancet diet in Denmark.

To summarize, our research highlights the need for proactive adaptation in Danish agriculture. By improving soil health and implementing resilient practices, farmers can ensure sustainability despite climate challenges.

Thank you for listening. I’m happy to take any questions.
