# Early detection of bark beetle infestation in Norway spruce forests of Central Europe using Sentinel-2

**利用Sentinel-2对中欧挪威云杉森林中树皮甲虫侵染的早期检测**


## 0. Abstract 

In the past decade, massive outbreaks of bark beetles (Ips spp.) have caused large-scale decline of coniferous-dominated, prevailingly managed forests of Central Europe. Timely detection of newly infested trees is important for minimizing economic losses and effectively planning forest management activities to stop or at least slow outbreaks. With the advancement of Copernicus services, a pair of Sentinel-2 satellites provides a unique remote sensing data source of multi-temporal observations in high spatial resolution on the scale of individual forest stands (although not allowing for individual tree detection). This study investigates the potential for using seasonal trajectories of Sentinel-2 bands and selected vegetation indices in early detection of bark beetle infestation (so–called green-attack stage detection) in Norway spruce monoculture forests in the Czech Republic. Spectral trajectories of nine bands and six vegetation indices were constructed for the 2018 vegetation season using 14 satellite observations from April to November to distinguish four infestation classes. We used a random forest algorithm to classify healthy (i.e., stands not infested) and infested trees with various trajectories of decay. The seasonal trajectories of vegetation indices separated the infestation classes better than did the individual bands. Among the most promising vegetation indices we identified the tasselled cap wetness (TCW) component and normalized difference index constructed from near and shortwave infrared bands. Analysing the inter-annual change of the indices was more promising for early detection than is single-date classification. It achieved 96% classification accuracy on day of year 291 for the tested data set. The algorithm for early detection of tree infestation based on the assessment of seasonal changes in TCW was applied on the time series of Sentinel-2 observations from 2019 and its outputs were verified using field observations of forest conditions conducted on 80 spruce forest plots (located in spruce monoculture stands). The overall accuracy of 78% was achieved for the separation of healthy and green-attack classes. Our study highlights the great potential of multi-temporal remote sensing and the use of shortwave infrared wavelengths for early detection of spruce forest decline caused by bark beetle infestation.

在过去十年中，大规模的树皮甲虫（Ips spp.）爆发导致了中欧以针叶树为主的管理森林的大范围衰退。及时检测新受侵染的树木对于减少经济损失和有效规划森林管理活动以阻止或至少减缓疫情蔓延至关重要。随着哥白尼计划的推进，一对Sentinel-2卫星提供了独特的多时相遥感数据源，能够在单个林分尺度上实现高空间分辨率的观测（尽管无法实现单木检测）。本研究探讨了利用Sentinel-2波段和选定植被指数的季节性轨迹在捷克挪威云杉纯林中进行树皮甲虫侵染早期检测（即所谓的“绿攻击”阶段检测）的潜力。利用2018年4月至11月的14次卫星观测数据，构建了9个波段和6种植被指数的光谱轨迹，以区分四种侵染等级。我们使用随机森林算法对健康（即未受侵染的林分）和具有不同衰退轨迹的受侵染树木进行分类。植被指数的季节性轨迹比单个波段更能区分侵染等级。在最有潜力的植被指数中，我们确定了帽状湿度分量（TCW）以及由近红外和短波红外波段构建的归一化差异指数。分析这些指数的年际变化比单时相分类更有助于早期检测。在测试数据集中，该方法的分类准确率在第291天达到了96%。基于TCW季节性变化评估的树木侵染早期检测算法被应用于2019年的Sentinel-2观测时间序列，并通过在80个云杉林样地（位于云杉纯林中）进行的森林状况实地观测验证了其输出结果。健康类和绿攻击类的总体分类准确率为78%。我们的研究凸显了多时相遥感技术和短波红外波段在早期检测由树皮甲虫侵染引起的云杉林衰退方面的巨大潜力。

## 1.Introduction

Bark beetles are one of the most dangerous pests for forests. Massive outbreaks of bark beetle species (Ips spp.) are currently spreading across forests dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) in Germany, Austria, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic (Grodzki et al., 2018, Kunca et al., 2018, Lubojacký et al., 2019) as a consequence of unsuitable species composition and extreme weather (several consecutive dry and hot summer months) that destabilized the forest ecosystems of Central Europe. For instance, forests in the Czech Republic in particular have been seriously impacted as the area of productive spruce forests infested by bark beetles has been increasing every year since 2014 and salvage felling volume reached as much as 30 million m3 in 2019 and keep increasing (CZSO, 2020, Knížek and Liška, 2019).  

Under the normal conditions, a small population of bark beetles attack predominantly weakened trees with poor defence mechanisms (endemic stage), and this can be regarded as a natural remedial process in forest ecosystems (Woodward et al., 2018, Wulder et al., 2006). At epidemic levels, however, extreme weather events, such as windthrow or long-duration dry period cause damage and weakening defence mechanism of all trees, then the bark beetle may multiply a population size resulting in massive tree mortality (epidemic stage). During the epidemic period (often referred as outbreaks) bark beetles attack even healthy trees of nearly all age categories (Potterf et al., 2019, Woodward et al., 2018).  

Six bark beetle species (Ips spp.) are naturally present in Central Europe, but only three of these pose a severe threat to Norway spruce trees, namely Ips typographus, Ips duplicatus, and Ips amitinus (Zahradník and Knížek, 2007). The first two bark beetle species attack older trees (typically older than 40 years in the case of I. duplicatus, and older than 60 years in case of I. typographus), whereas I. amitinus typically attacks younger spruce trees or branches of mature trees. I. duplicatus is considered the most severe insect agent due to its capability of rapid reproduction, forming multiple generations (typically two or three) and its preference to attack healthy trees in the upper canopy positions at the boundary layer between dry and green branches. From there it continues spreading into the lower and higher parts of the stem (Knížek and Liška, 2019). Trees attacked by I. duplicatus share many similar symptoms with those attacked by I. typographus but differ by location of the first attack, which spreads along thinner, upper parts of the stem and larger branches inside the crown (Knížek and Zahradník, 2004). Nevertheless, the activity of all three species can be found in different parts of a tree simultaneously.  

The physical symptoms of tree infestation typically include the appearance of small holes on the trunk and dry dust findings at the bottom of tree stems, which are often used by forest managers for early identification of infested trees (Lubojacký et al., 2018). These are latter followed by visible biological symptoms including changes in needle colour, defoliation and bark decay. As individual trees might react differently during the early stage of infestation, relying on visual biological symptoms might hamper the timely early detection. The tree infestation process is often classified into three stages: green-, red-, and grey-attack (e.g., Wermelinger, 2004, Wulder et al., 2006). In the green-attack stage, the infested trees show no visible colour changes of its needles, but the trees already are on a decay trajectory that cannot be reversed. Subsequently, needles start to change their colour over time from green to yellow and then to red (so called the red-attack stage) due to the degradation of chlorophyll pigment molecules (Skakun et al., 2003, Wulder et al., 2006), which makes the infestation visually detectable. Abdullah et al., 2019b referred that for Norway spruce trees the first two stages (green- and red-attack phase) usually occur within one to six months after the initial attack, while the last stage (grey-attack) take place from six months to one year after the initial attack of the beetles. It is important to realize that the duration of the individual attack stages differs, depending on particular bark beetle species, tree species, tree vitality, and specific local environmental conditions (Lubojacký et al., 2018). To mitigate the bark beetle impacts on forest ecosystems it is of the uttermost importance to detect the infested trees in their early stages (i.e., the pre-visual green-attack stage) in order to remove them from the forest before the formation of the new beetle generation.  
Bark beetle monitoring in Central Europe is traditionally performed by foresters during field surveys. Due to the current high outbreak levels, it is not feasible to monitor large areas in a sufficiently timely manner. Remote sensing can provide effective tools for timely, large-scale monitoring of bark beetle infestation at different stages (this topic was reviewed for instance by Senf et al., 2017, Wulder et al., 2006). The use of remote sensing for bark beetle monitoring has a long history in North America, where it has been used for detecting tree mortality (i.e., focus on red- or grey-attack stages) induced by mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae using mainly Landsat (Long and Lawrence, 2016, Meddens et al., 2013, Meigs et al., 2011, Skakun et al., 2003, Wulder et al., 2006) and MODIS imagery (Anees and Aryal, 2014a, Anees and Aryal, 2014b, Spruce et al., 2019). In Scandinavia, time series of MODIS data were used to map insect induced defoliation of Scots pine and birch forest stands (Eklundh et al., 2009, Olsson et al., 2016a, Olsson et al., 2016b). For fragmented forest landscape of Central Europe, MODIS-like data are less suitable for their coarse spatial resolution. In the Central European region, Landsat data were used for instance by Hais et al. (2016), who found that long-term, decreasing trend in spectral trajectories of tasselled cap components can predict bark beetle disturbances. Stych et al., 2019, Havašová et al., 2015 analysed forest disturbances after bark beetle outbreaks using time series of Landsat vegetation indices. Spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and high spatial resolution RapidEye data (Latifi et al., 2018), and combination Landsat and SPOT data (Latifi et al., 2014) were investigated to detect tree mortality caused by bark beetle in the Bavarian Forest national park. In the Czech Republic, maps of clear cuts and dead standing trees after bark beetle outbreaks are produced from high spatial resolution, commercial Planet Scope data three times per year (www.kurovcovamapa.cz). Recently, studies exploring Sentinel-2 data for bark beetle detection have also emerged (e.g. Abdullah et al., 2019a attempted an early identification of green-attack trees, whereas Zimmermann and Hoffmann, 2020, Zhan et al., 2020 mapped tree mortality). The majority of studies cited above, however, focus on mapping of red- and grey-attack stages, tree mortality, or forest disturbances in general, but such methods are not suited for early detection of infested trees (before apparent visual symptoms occur) and therefore cannot help to effectively plan management measures as salvage logging (Immitzer and Atzberger, 2014).  

Several attempts have been made to monitor early infestation stages (i.e., green-attack), but these typically have produced ambiguous results. There is evidence that leaf-level spectral differences between healthy and infested trees in the early stage do exist for Norway spruce (Abdullah et al., 2018) and Engelmann spruce (Foster et al., 2017). Abdullah et al. (2018) identified the most pronounced spectral differences within the red-edge region, whereas Foster et al. (2017) found the shortwave infrared region as being the most relevant. Additionally, needles of infested trees show decrease in some leaf traits such as chlorophyll, water and nitrogen content compared to healthy trees (Abdullah et al., 2019b). bands. Separating between healthy and green-attack classes at the canopy level is often challenging (e.g., Lausch et al., 2013) due to the structural complexity of forest canopies and upscaling of leaf-level signal to the level of whole forest stands. Studies of early detection carried at the local level using airborne hyperspectral data (Fassnacht et al., 2014, Lausch et al., 2013) or data from unmanned aerial systems (Dash et al., 2017, Klouček et al., 2019, Näsi et al., 2018) are not suited to national-level monitoring, which would effectively help to fight against massive outbreaks spreading throughout Central Europe. Such could be achieved only by using satellite data as shown by Immitzer and Atzberger (2014), who analysed high spatial resolution, commercial WorldView-2 data in central Austria and were able to classify healthy and green-attack Norway spruce trees with the accuracy of 75%. Combination of RapidEye and TerraSAR-X data were used for early detection study in Germany, showing that the highest classification accuracy (kappa = 0.74) was found for the multisource datasets (Ortiz et al., 2013). Potential for early detection of bark beetle may provide Sentinel-2 satellite system, which allows for the first time for high temporal resolution monitoring in wide range of spectral regions. Abdullah et al. (2019a) explored Sentinel-2 data for early green-attack stage detection. This study showed that a single-date Sentinel-2 data were more accurate for early detection of bark beetle attack than the Landsat-8 data (accuracy of 67% for Sentinel-2 compared to 36% for Landsat-8 data). In other study, Abdullah et al. (2019b) proposed an innovative approach to investigate temporal response of leaf traits and canopy reflectance within a course of a single vegetation season using the combination of high spatial resolution RapidEye and SPOT-5 images showing that the infested trees could be detected earliest in late June. Time series and trend analysis over multiple years were shown to be useful for mapping of bark beetle calamity impacts (e.g., Hais et al., 2016, Meigs et al., 2011, Tane et al., 2018) or forest disturbance and recovery caused by agents other than bark beetle (Kennedy et al., 2010, Kennedy et al., 2007).  

Therefore, the main goal of our study was to detect early, pre-visual stages of bark beetle infestation on Norway spruce trees by tracking their within season changes of canopy reflectance observed by Sentinel-2 satellite system. Our hypothesis is that the early symptoms of beetle infestations could be detected when comparing the canopy reflectance of pre-attack stage (baseline) against the ongoing gradual changes of canopy reflectance induced by the beetles. In the study, we quantify the importance of individual spectral bands and their temporal separability to develop a classification model of early, pre-visual detection of bark beetle infestation.  

树皮甲虫是森林中最危险的害虫之一。近年来，由于不适宜的树种组成和极端天气（连续数月干燥炎热的夏季），树皮甲虫（Ips spp.）的大规模爆发正在德国、奥地利、波兰、斯洛伐克和捷克等以挪威云杉（Picea abies）为主的森林中蔓延，导致中欧森林生态系统的不稳定（Grodzki等，2018；Kunca等，2018；Lubojacký等，2019）。例如，捷克的森林尤其受到严重影响，自2014年以来，受树皮甲虫侵染的生产性云杉林面积逐年增加，2019年的抢救性采伐量达到3000万立方米，并且仍在持续增长（CZSO，2020；Knížek和Liška，2019）。  

在正常情况下，少量的树皮甲虫主要攻击防御机制较弱的树木（地方性阶段），这可以被视为森林生态系统中的一种自然修复过程（Woodward等，2018；Wulder等，2006）。然而，在流行病水平上，极端天气事件（如风倒或长期干旱）会导致所有树木受损并削弱其防御机制，随后树皮甲虫种群数量激增，导致大规模树木死亡（流行病阶段）。在流行病期间（通常称为爆发），树皮甲虫甚至会攻击几乎所有年龄段的健康树木（Potterf等，2019；Woodward等，2018）。  

中欧自然存在六种树皮甲虫（Ips spp.），但其中只有三种对挪威云杉构成严重威胁，分别是云杉八齿小蠹（Ips typographus）、重齿小蠹（Ips duplicatus）和小八齿小蠹（Ips amitinus）（Zahradník和Knížek，2007）。前两种树皮甲虫主要攻击较老的树木（通常I. duplicatus攻击40年以上的树木，I. typographus攻击60年以上的树木），而I. amitinus通常攻击较年轻的云杉树或成熟树木的枝条。I. duplicatus被认为是最严重的昆虫媒介，因为它具有快速繁殖的能力，能够形成多个世代（通常为两到三代），并且偏好攻击位于干燥和绿色枝条交界处上层冠层位置的健康树木。从那里，它继续向树干的下部和上部蔓延（Knížek和Liška，2019）。被I. duplicatus攻击的树木与被I. typographus攻击的树木有许多相似的症状，但不同之处在于首次攻击的位置，前者沿着较细的树干上部和冠层内较大的枝条蔓延（Knížek和Zahradník，2004）。然而，这三种树皮甲虫的活动可能同时出现在树木的不同部位。  

树木受侵染的物理症状通常包括树干上出现小孔和树干底部发现干燥的木屑，这些症状常被森林管理者用于早期识别受侵染的树木（Lubojacký等，2018）。随后会出现可见的生物症状，包括针叶颜色变化、落叶和树皮腐烂。由于个体树木在侵染早期可能表现出不同的反应，依赖视觉生物症状可能会妨碍及时的早期检测。树木侵染过程通常分为三个阶段：绿攻击、红攻击和灰攻击（例如，Wermelinger，2004；Wulder等，2006）。在绿攻击阶段，受侵染的树木针叶没有明显的颜色变化，但树木已经进入不可逆转的衰退轨迹。随后，由于叶绿素分子的降解，针叶颜色逐渐从绿色变为黄色，然后变为红色（即红攻击阶段）（Skakun等，2003；Wulder等，2006），这使得侵染变得肉眼可见。Abdullah等（2019b）指出，对于挪威云杉，前两个阶段（绿攻击和红攻击阶段）通常在初次侵染后1至6个月内发生，而最后一个阶段（灰攻击阶段）则在初次侵染后6个月至1年内发生。需要注意的是，各个侵染阶段的持续时间因树皮甲虫种类、树种、树木活力以及特定的当地环境条件而异（Lubojacký等，2018）。为了减轻树皮甲虫对森林生态系统的影响，最关键的是在侵染早期（即视觉不可见的绿攻击阶段）检测到受侵染的树木，以便在新一代甲虫形成之前将其从森林中移除。  

中欧的树皮甲虫监测传统上由森林管理员通过实地调查进行。由于目前爆发水平较高，无法及时监测大面积区域。遥感技术可以为不同阶段的树皮甲虫侵染提供及时、大规模的监测工具（例如，Senf等，2017；Wulder等，2006对此进行了综述）。在北美，遥感用于树皮甲虫监测已有很长的历史，主要用于检测由山松甲虫（Dendroctonus ponderosae）引起的树木死亡（即关注红攻击或灰攻击阶段），主要使用Landsat（Long和Lawrence，2016；Meddens等，2013；Meigs等，2011；Skakun等，2003；Wulder等，2006）和MODIS影像（Anees和Aryal，2014a；Anees和Aryal，2014b；Spruce等，2019）。在斯堪的纳维亚，MODIS数据的时间序列被用于绘制由昆虫引起的苏格兰松树和桦树林的落叶图（Eklundh等，2009；Olsson等，2016a；Olsson等，2016b）。对于中欧的碎片化森林景观，类似MODIS的数据由于其较低的空间分辨率而不太适用。在中欧地区，Landsat数据被用于例如Hais等（2016）的研究，他们发现帽状分量光谱轨迹的长期下降趋势可以预测树皮甲虫的干扰。Stych等（2019）和Havašová等（2015）使用Landsat植被指数的时间序列分析了树皮甲虫爆发后的森林干扰。在巴伐利亚森林国家公园，研究了MODIS和高空间分辨率RapidEye数据的时空融合（Latifi等，2018）以及Landsat和SPOT数据的组合（Latifi等，2014）以检测由树皮甲虫引起的树木死亡。在捷克，每年三次从高空间分辨率的商业Planet Scope数据中生成树皮甲虫爆发后的皆伐和枯立木地图（www.kurovcovamapa.cz）。最近，探索Sentinel-2数据用于树皮甲虫检测的研究也开始出现（例如，Abdullah等，2019a尝试了绿攻击树木的早期识别，而Zimmermann和Hoffmann，2020；Zhan等，2020则绘制了树木死亡图）。然而，上述大多数研究主要集中在红攻击和灰攻击阶段的绘制、树木死亡或一般森林干扰的监测上，但这些方法不适用于侵染树木的早期检测（在明显的视觉症状出现之前），因此无法有效帮助规划抢救性采伐等管理措施（Immitzer和Atzberger，2014）。  

已有多次尝试监测早期侵染阶段（即绿攻击阶段），但这些尝试通常产生了模棱两可的结果。有证据表明，挪威云杉（Abdullah等，2018）和恩格尔曼云杉（Foster等，2017）在侵染早期的叶片光谱差异确实存在。Abdullah等（2018）发现红边区域的光谱差异最为显著，而Foster等（2017）则认为短波红外区域最为相关。此外，受侵染树木的针叶在叶绿素、水分和氮含量等叶片性状上比健康树木有所下降（Abdullah等，2019b）。在冠层水平上区分健康类和绿攻击类通常具有挑战性（例如，Lausch等，2013），这是由于森林冠层的结构复杂性以及从叶片水平信号到整个林分水平的尺度扩展问题。使用机载高光谱数据（Fassnacht等，2014；Lausch等，2013）或无人机系统数据（Dash等，2017；Klouček等，2019；Näsi等，2018）进行的局部早期检测研究并不适合国家级监测，而国家级监测可以有效帮助应对中欧大规模爆发的树皮甲虫。只有通过卫星数据才能实现这一目标，例如Immitzer和Atzberger（2014）在奥地利中部分析了高空间分辨率的商业WorldView-2数据，能够以75%的准确率分类健康和绿攻击的挪威云杉树。在德国，RapidEye和TerraSAR-X数据的组合被用于早期检测研究，结果显示多源数据集的分类准确率最高（kappa = 0.74）（Ortiz等，2013）。Sentinel-2卫星系统可能为树皮甲虫的早期检测提供潜力，该系统首次实现了高时间分辨率的多光谱区域监测。Abdullah等（2019a）探索了Sentinel-2数据用于绿攻击阶段的早期检测。该研究表明，单时相Sentinel-2数据在树皮甲虫攻击的早期检测中比Landsat-8数据更准确（Sentinel-2的准确率为67%，而Landsat-8为36%）。在另一项研究中，Abdullah等（2019b）提出了一种创新方法，通过结合高空间分辨率的RapidEye和SPOT-5图像，研究单个植被季节内叶片性状和冠层反射率的时间响应，结果显示受侵染的树木最早可以在6月下旬被检测到。多年时间序列和趋势分析已被证明可用于绘制树皮甲虫灾害影响图（例如，Hais等，2016；Meigs等，2011；Tane等，2018）或由树皮甲虫以外的因素引起的森林干扰和恢复图（Kennedy等，2010；Kennedy等，2007）。
  
因此，本研究的主要目标是通过跟踪Sentinel-2卫星系统观测到的冠层反射率的季节性变化，检测挪威云杉树皮甲虫侵染的早期、视觉不可见阶段。我们的假设是，通过比较侵染前阶段（基线）的冠层反射率与甲虫引起的冠层反射率的逐渐变化，可以检测到甲虫侵染的早期症状。在研究中，我们量化了各个光谱波段的重要性及其时间可分性，以开发一种早期、视觉不可见树皮甲虫侵染的分类模型。

## 2. Material and methods  

**2.1. Bark beetle infestation**  

We realized that the definition of bark beetle infestation stages in the literature is not always consistent. Different authors define their own stages of infestation, which may or may not correspond to the commonly used terminology of green-, red- and grey-attack stages (Wulder et al., 2006). This makes it difficult to compare the results with those from other studies. Transition from healthy to green-attack and following stages will always be a dynamic process in time and space that is driven by many environmental factors. Our definition of forest infestation classes, therefore, was driven by time when infested forests reached the red-attack stage with obvious visual symptoms that can be well identified from remote sensing observations. The first indication of infestation is apparent in spring with rising temperatures that trigger the swarm of a new generation of bark beetles overwintering in trees infested at the end of the previous vegetation season. New trees infested by current-year bark beetle generations (first and second) reaches green- and red-attack stage within the same year, however the timing depends on the actual weather condition, stand location, and individual tree vigour. From November until the following spring, the dieback process is decelerated due to the dormancy of bark beetles. The process nevertheless might progress into a red-attack stage on a limited number of trees. According to forest managers (personal communication), this period is most suitable for proactive measures, which means seeking out infested trees and removing them from the forest before next spring.  

**2.2. Study area**  

The Vysočina region (Bohemian–Moravian Highlands) in the central part of the Czech Republic (Fig. 1) was selected as the pilot study area. The Vysočina region is characterized by mean altitude of 500 m above sea level (ranging between 239 and 837 m a.s.L.), mean annual temperature between 6 and 8˚C and precipitation between 500 and 800 mm (CZSO, 2021). A large proportion of forest stands in this region are managed, production monocultures of Norway spruce that have been seriously damaged by an ongoing bark beetle outbreak since 2018. According to the national bark beetle information system (Kůrovcové Info, 2018), bark beetles swarmed three times in 2018, whereas two life cycles are typical for the species and local conditions (Wermelinger, 2004). Some observations even suggest four swarming or continuous swarming of bark beetle (P. Zahradník, Forestry and Game Management Research Institute, personal communication). Such extreme pest pressure has resulted in the loss of almost 15% of the timber volume in production spruce forests within this region during 2015–2019 (Adolt et al., 2020). Within the Vysočina region we selected several areas for model training and validation. The district of Třebíč was selected to define forest polygons in different bark beetle infestation stages for training purposes (Fig. 1). Spruce forests in this district were affected by severe bark beetle infestation since 2018 most. Besides the Třebíč district several areas within the Vysočina region were selected for our surveys to verify our final classification map in the field (see Fig. 1).  

**2.3. Selection of training polygons**  

Within Třebíč District, we manually selected polygons with Norway spruce forests in different stages of bark beetle infestation. The selection procedure was based on visual interpretation of publicly available aerial orthophotomaps from 2017 (Seznam, a.s.) and 2018 (Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre) combined with forest structure and species composition maps and a map of recently logged or dead spruce forests (i.e., stands in red- or grey-attack stage found between April and September in 2018 and 2019) provided by the Forest Management Institute of the Czech Republic (the ancillary maps provided by the Forest Management Institute can be accessed via their geoportal http://geoportal.uhul.cz/mapy/MapyDpz.html). We manually identified 44 polygons with minimum size 30 × 30 m for Norway spruce-dominated forest stands older than 40 years. All established polygons were composed of trees that had been healthy (i.e., green trees with no obvious visual symptoms of decline) in summer 2017 but were undergoing forest decline (i.e., transition from green- to red-attack stage) during either the 2018 or 2019 vegetation season. Based on the trajectory of the decline, the polygons were divided into four classes as follows:  
- **Class i**: Trees that remained healthy (not infested) during the entire study period until summer 2019 (total area 6.12 ha, 12 polygons).  
- **Class ii**: Trees that experienced red-attack (i.e., visual symptoms of infestation) during summer 2018 (total area 6.2 ha, 15 polygons).  
- **Class iii**: Trees that experienced red-attack during autumn 2018 (total area 2 ha, 7 polygons).  
- **Class iv**: Trees that were green during 2018 and experienced red-attack stage during summer 2019 (total area 4.3 ha, 10 polygons).  

Whenever possible, we identified the class i (healthy) forest polygons within the same tree age category as nearby infested forest stands (classes ii – iv) (Fig. 1). We shall note here, that for none of the three infested classes (ii – iv) the timing of the green-attack stage could not be exactly identified, but can be assumed to occur 1–6 months before clear visual symptoms (red-attack stage) (Abdullah et al., 2019b).  

**2.4. Selection and pre-processing of Sentinel-2 satellite images**  

We used Sentinel-2 observations distributed as Level 2A (top of canopy reflectance). The data were downloaded from ESA Copernicus open access hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu). To avoid impact of clouds and cloud shadows, only cloud-free data for our area of interest were manually selected. In total, 14 Sentinel-2 images from April until November 2018 were selected. Their exact acquisition dates are summarized in Table 1. It should be noted that the particular DOY indicating the separation between the healthy and infested forest classes will be inevitably dependent on the availability of satellite images and specific vegetation and climatic conditions. Six VIs were tested for the purpose of this study, including three normalized difference indices, one red-edge inflection point, and two tasselled cap components (see Table 2). For the computation of VIs and further analysis, we utilized only 9 out of 13 spectral bands (those with nominal spatial resolution of 10 and 20 m), which were resampled to the same pixel size of 20 m. NDVI-based indices (NDVI550/650, NDVI800/650, NDVI819/1649) were selected for their good performance in previous studies focused on red-attack stage mapping (Latifi et al., 2018, Meddens et al., 2013, Tane et al., 2018) or green-attack stage mapping (Klouček et al., 2019). The red-edge inflection point (REIP) utilizes the unique Sentinel-2 red-edge bands. REIP is often used for vegetation stress and vitality assessment (e.g., by Ali et al., 2020, Mercier et al., 2020), but to date it had not been tested for bark beetle detection. Two tasselled cap components, greenness (TCG) and wetness (TCW), were computed according to Landsat-based transformation coefficients applied to Sentinel-2 (Crist, 1985, Crist and Cicone, 1984). The tasselled cap transformation had previously been applied for Landsat data to assess bark beetle damage (Meddens et al., 2013, Skakun et al., 2003, Woodward et al., 2018).  

**2.5. Analysis of spectral trajectories and model development**  

**2.5.1. Analysis of seasonal trajectories**  

### 英文原文：
Seasonal trajectories of forest canopy reflectance for nine spectral bands and six vegetation indices were extracted for each forest polygon. Subsequently, the average trajectory was computed for each infestation class. Spectral trajectories were analysed while emphasizing early detection of infestation, whereas identification of red-attack stages were given low priority in algorithm development. Our main goal was to evaluate separability between the healthy (class i) and two infested stages (classes iii and iv) as an example of early detection. Separability between class i and class ii was not evaluated due to a considerable gap in Sentinel-2 observation during July when the two trajectories started to separate. Differences between classes i and iii, and i and iv during a specific day of year (DOY) were analysed by a random forest algorithm using both absolute values (spectral bands and VIs) and relative change (VIs only) as inputs. Seasonal change represents the difference between values from two studied periods, either within a single vegetation season or between two consecutive seasons. A similar approach had been used by Skakun et al. (2003), who computed enhanced wetness difference index for detecting red-attack stage as the difference in tasselled cap wetness component between the two vegetation seasons. In this study, the relative change was computed within the single vegetation season and is related to an initial reference period (baseline) as follows:  

$$ \text{Seasonal change} = \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{Actual}_{DOY_i} - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \text{Baseline}_{DOY_j} \right) $$

where \(i\) and \(j\) indicate the time range of analysed images, and \(n\) and \(m\) represent the number of selected images in the Actual or Baseline data sets, respectively.  

The baseline should ideally be calculated as an average of several successive observations to reduce potential errors originating from the atmospheric corrections or presence of cloud shadows or snow cover in the studied pixel. In addition, the baseline should be assessed within a stable (dormant) vegetation period, preferably in late winter or early spring under snow-free conditions and before development of the current year’s shoots. In our case, the baseline represents an average of Sentinel-2 observations for DOYs 101, 111, and 126.  

Similarly, the actual situation (i.e., infestation detection date) could be derived either from a single observation or as an average of multiple consecutive observations. For operational mapping of the actual situation in forest stands, using single-observation data will likely be acceptable because it can be difficult to obtain several cloud-free images within a short period of time.  

**2.5.2. Development of the early forest disturbance classification model**  
In developing a classification model, we used the random forest (RF) method as implemented in the Statistic and Machine Learning Toolbox in MATLAB r2016b software. Use of a single decision tree has a tendency for overfitting, and therefore the RF method is preferred because it combines results of many decision trees. The RF algorithm chooses a random subset of variables to use at each decision node. The number of trees and the number of selected variables are the main model input parameters (Breiman, 2001, Liaw and Wiener, 2002). We trained an RF algorithm using 200 trees and the TreeBagger function, which enables evaluating the importance of each predictor (spectral channel or VI) for classification.  
The predictors in the RF model were the absolute values of the Sentinel-2 spectral bands and derived VIs, as well as seasonal changes values for VIs only. The RF input data were split into training and validation subsets in a ratio of 70:30. Classification models were tested for each observation date during the period DOY 151–321.  

**2.6. Model application and validation by field observations**  
The best classification model calibrated on 2018 Sentinel-2 observations (random forest classification thresholds were derived for the TCW seasonal change at DOY 291 as further discussed in section 3.2) was implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to produce maps of the bark beetle infestation stages for the Vysočina Region for autumn 2019. GEE (Gorelick et al., 2017) is a cloud computing environment allowing for automated mass processing of remote sensing data. The baseline was computed from cloud-free Sentinel observations between DOY 75 and DOY 100, whereas the actual period for early detection mapping was between DOY 288 and DOY 303. The classification map in nominal spatial resolution of 20 m was produced for forested pixels only using a mask of tree species produced by the Forest Management Institute (the map of tree species can be accessed via their geoportal http://geoportal.uhul.cz/mapy/MapyDpz.html).  
Validation of the classification of different infestation stages was carried out by visual inspection of 80 plots in the Vysočina Region during autumn and winter 2019/2020. Because our main goal concerned early detection, we targeted our field visits on forest stands that were classified as healthy (class i) and trees in the early infestation stage (green-attack) that will likely experience red-attack during the following vegetation season (class iv). At each location, Norway spruce trees were inspected visually to search for such bark beetle evidence as holes in the stem bark, and several photographs were taken to document the presence of visual symptoms (needle discolouration).  


**2. 材料与方法**  
**2.1. 树皮甲虫侵染**  
我们意识到文献中对树皮甲虫侵染阶段的定义并不总是一致的。不同的作者定义了各自的侵染阶段，这些定义可能与常用的绿攻击、红攻击和灰攻击阶段术语（Wulder等，2006）相符或不相符。这使得与其他研究结果的比较变得困难。从健康到绿攻击及后续阶段的转变始终是一个受多种环境因素驱动的时空动态过程。因此，我们对森林侵染类别的定义是基于受侵染森林达到红攻击阶段的时间，此时具有明显的视觉症状，可以通过遥感观测清晰识别。侵染的第一个迹象出现在春季，随着气温升高，越冬于前一植被季节末期受侵染树木中的新一代树皮甲虫开始群飞。受当年树皮甲虫世代（第一代和第二代）侵染的新树木在同一植被季节内达到绿攻击和红攻击阶段，但具体时间取决于实际天气条件、林分位置和个体树木活力。从11月到次年春季，由于树皮甲虫的休眠，树木死亡过程减缓。尽管如此，部分树木仍可能进入红攻击阶段。根据森林管理者的反馈（个人交流），这一时期最适合采取主动措施，即在次年春季之前寻找并移除受侵染的树木。  

**2.2. 研究区域**  
研究选择了捷克共和国中部的Vysočina地区（波希米亚-摩拉维亚高地）作为试点研究区域（图1）。Vysočina地区的平均海拔为500米（范围在239至837米之间），年平均气温为6至8˚C，年降水量为500至800毫米（CZSO，2021）。该地区的大部分林分为管理的挪威云杉生产性纯林，自2018年以来受到树皮甲虫爆发的严重破坏。根据国家树皮甲虫信息系统（Kůrovcové Info，2018），2018年树皮甲虫群飞了三次，而该物种和当地条件下的典型生命周期为两次（Wermelinger，2004）。一些观察甚至表明树皮甲虫群飞了四次或持续群飞（P. Zahradník，林业和狩猎管理研究所，个人交流）。这种极端的害虫压力导致2015-2019年间该地区生产性云杉林的木材量损失了近15%（Adolt等，2020）。在Vysočina地区内，我们选择了多个区域进行模型训练和验证。Třebíč区被选为定义不同树皮甲虫侵染阶段的森林多边形以用于训练目的（图1）。自2018年以来，该区的云杉林受到严重的树皮甲虫侵染。除了Třebíč区，Vysočina地区的其他几个区域也被选中用于实地验证我们的最终分类图（见图1）。  

**2.3. 训练多边形的选择**  
在Třebíč区内，我们手动选择了处于不同树皮甲虫侵染阶段的挪威云杉林多边形。选择过程基于对2017年（Seznam, a.s.）和2018年（捷克测绘和地籍办公室）公开航空正射影像的视觉解译，并结合森林结构和树种组成图以及捷克林业管理研究所提供的近期采伐或枯死云杉林地图（即在2018年和2019年4月至9月期间发现的红攻击或灰攻击阶段的林分）（林业管理研究所提供的辅助地图可通过其地理门户http://geoportal.uhul.cz/mapy/MapyDpz.html访问）。我们手动识别了44个最小面积为30 × 30米的以挪威云杉为主的40年以上林分多边形。所有建立的多边形均由2017年夏季健康（即没有明显衰退视觉症状的绿色树木）但在2018年或2019年植被季节经历森林衰退（即从绿攻击阶段过渡到红攻击阶段）的树木组成。根据衰退轨迹，多边形被分为以下四类：  
- **类别i**：在整个研究期间直至2019年夏季保持健康（未受侵染）的树木（总面积6.12公顷，12个多边形）。  
- **类别ii**：在2018年夏季经历红攻击（即侵染的视觉症状）的树木（总面积6.2公顷，15个多边形）。  
- **类别iii**：在2018年秋季经历红攻击的树木（总面积2公顷，7个多边形）。  
- **类别iv**：在2018年保持绿色并在2019年夏季经历红攻击阶段的树木（总面积4.3公顷，10个多边形）。  

在可能的情况下，我们将类别i（健康）的森林多边形与附近受侵染林分（类别ii-iv）的树木年龄类别保持一致（图1）。需要注意的是，对于三个受侵染类别（ii-iv），绿攻击阶段的时间无法精确确定，但可以假设在明显视觉症状（红攻击阶段）出现前1-6个月发生（Abdullah等，2019b）。  

**2.4. Sentinel-2卫星影像的选择与预处理**  
我们使用了Sentinel-2 Level 2A（冠层反射率）观测数据。数据从ESA哥白尼开放访问中心（https://scihub.copernicus.eu）下载。为了避免云和云阴影的影响，我们手动选择了研究区域内无云的影像。总共选择了2018年4月至11月的14幅Sentinel-2影像。其具体获取日期总结在表1中。需要注意的是，区分健康和受侵染森林类别的具体DOY（年积日）不可避免地依赖于卫星影像的可用性以及特定的植被和气候条件。本研究测试了六种植被指数（VIs），包括三种归一化差异指数、一种红边拐点和两种帽状分量（见表2）。为了计算植被指数并进行进一步分析，我们仅使用了13个光谱波段中的9个（名义空间分辨率为10米和20米的波段），并将其重采样为相同的20米像素大小。基于NDVI的指数（NDVI550/650、NDVI800/650、NDVI819/1649）因其在之前红攻击阶段制图（Latifi等，2018；Meddens等，2013；Tane等，2018）或绿攻击阶段制图（Klouček等，2019）研究中的良好表现而被选中。红边拐点（REIP）利用了Sentinel-2独特的红边波段。REIP通常用于植被胁迫和活力评估（例如，Ali等，2020；Mercier等，2020），但迄今为止尚未用于树皮甲虫检测。两种帽状分量——绿度（TCG）和湿度（TCW）——根据应用于Sentinel-2的Landsat变换系数计算（Crist，1985；Crist和Cicone，1984）。帽状变换此前已应用于Landsat数据以评估树皮甲虫损害（Meddens等，2013；Skakun等，2003；Woodward等，2018）。  

**2.5. 光谱轨迹分析与模型开发**  
**2.5.1. 季节性轨迹分析**  
为每个森林多边形提取了九个光谱波段和六种植被指数的冠层反射率季节性轨迹。随后，计算了每个侵染类别的平均轨迹。光谱轨迹分析的重点是侵染的早期检测，而红攻击阶段的识别在算法开发中被赋予较低的优先级。我们的主要目标是评估健康类别（类别i）和两个受侵染阶段（类别iii和iv）之间的可分性，作为早期检测的示例。由于7月Sentinel-2观测的显著缺失，未评估类别i和ii之间的可分性，此时两条轨迹开始分离。使用随机森林算法分析了特定年积日（DOY）下类别i与iii、以及类别i与iv之间的差异，输入数据包括绝对值（光谱波段和植被指数）和相对变化（仅植被指数）。季节性变化表示两个研究时期之间的差异，可以是单个植被季节内或两个连续季节之间的差异。Skakun等（2003）使用了类似的方法，他们计算了增强湿度差异指数，用于检测红攻击阶段，作为两个植被季节之间帽状湿度分量的差异。在本研究中，相对变化是在单个植被季节内计算的，并与初始参考期（基线）相关，公式如下：  

$$ \text{季节性变化} = \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{实际}_{DOY_i} - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \text{基线}_{DOY_j} \right) $$

其中，\(i\) 和 \(j\) 表示分析影像的时间范围，\(n\) 和 \(m\) 分别表示实际数据集和基线数据集中选择的影像数量。  

基线值应理想地计算为多次连续观测的平均值，以减少由大气校正或研究像素中云阴影或积雪引起的潜在误差。此外，基线应在稳定的（休眠）植被期内评估，最好是在无雪的晚冬或早春，且在当年新梢发育之前。在本研究中，基线值为DOY 101、111和126的Sentinel-2观测平均值。  

同样，实际状况（即侵染检测日期）可以从单次观测或多次连续观测的平均值中得出。对于森林林分的实际状况制图，使用单次观测数据可能是可接受的，因为在短时间内获取多幅无云影像可能较为困难。


**2.5.2. 早期森林干扰分类模型的开发**  
在开发分类模型时，我们使用了MATLAB r2016b软件中的统计和机器学习工具箱中实现的随机森林（RF）方法。单一决策树容易过拟合，因此RF方法更受青睐，因为它结合了多个决策树的结果。RF算法在每个决策节点选择随机变量子集。树的数量和选择的变量数量是模型的主要输入参数（Breiman，2001；Liaw和Wiener，2002）。我们使用200棵树和TreeBagger函数训练了RF算法，该函数能够评估每个预测变量（光谱通道或植被指数）对分类的重要性。  
RF模型中的预测变量包括Sentinel-2光谱波段的绝对值、衍生的植被指数以及仅植被指数的季节性变化值。RF输入数据按70:30的比例分为训练集和验证集。分类模型在DOY 151-321期间的每个观测日期进行了测试。  

**2.6. 模型应用与实地观测验证**  
基于2018年Sentinel-2观测数据校准的最佳分类模型（随机森林分类阈值在DOY 291的TCW季节性变化中得出，详见第3.2节）在Google Earth Engine（GEE）中实现，以生成2019年秋季Vysočina地区树皮甲虫侵染阶段的地图。GEE（Gorelick等，2017）是一个允许自动化批量处理遥感数据的云计算环境。基线值是根据DOY 75至DOY 100期间的无云Sentinel观测数据计算的，而早期检测制图的实际期为DOY 288至DOY 303。分类图的名义空间分辨率为20米，仅针对森林像素生成，使用了林业管理研究所提供的树种掩膜（树种地图可通过其地理门户http://geoportal.uhul.cz/mapy/MapyDpz.html访问）。  
不同侵染阶段分类的验证通过2019/2020年秋冬期间对Vysočina地区80个样地的视觉检查进行。由于我们的主要目标是早期检测，我们将实地访问重点放在被分类为健康（类别i）和处于早期侵染阶段（绿攻击）的森林林分上，这些林分可能在接下来的植被季节经历红攻击（类别iv）。在每个地点，对挪威云杉树进行视觉检查，寻找树皮上的孔洞等树皮甲虫证据，并拍摄多张照片以记录视觉症状（针叶变色）的存在。

## 3. Results

**3.1. Sentinel-2 spectral bands**  
Analysis of forest development under bark beetle attack was performed using a dense time series of Sentinel-2 observations. We obtained 14 Sentinel-2 acquisitions from early April through the end of November 2018. The number of suitable observations was constrained by the presence of snow, cloud cover, and cloud shadows, which for instance resulted in one-month gap in the data starting from 30 June until 6 August.  
In the first step, we assessed the potential of each Sentinel-2 band for detecting early stages of bark beetle infestation. Fig. 2 shows the spectral trajectories (mean and standard deviation) for each band and Fig. 3 shows spectral reflectance for each class at DOY 126 and 291. Based on Fig. 2, the highest potentials for separation between the healthy and infestation classes are observed for bands B4 (red), B5 (red-edge), and B11, B12 (in SWIR). The other two visible bands B2 (blue) and B3 (green), bands B6, B7 (red-edge), and B8a (NIR) seem to be least sensitive for detecting infestation in our study. In general, all spectral trajectories exhibit similar increase in canopy reflectance from the beginning of the vegetation season and peak at DOY 151 (end of May), which is most noteworthy in the visible bands. This is likely due to sprouting of the current year’s shoots as well as the development of understory vegetation and its contribution to the overall canopy signal. Variation of reflectance during the season, which is most pronounced in the blue band (B2), can be attributed in part to imperfections in the atmospheric corrections.  

**3.2. Vegetation indices**  
In the second step, we inspected spectral trajectories (mean and standard deviation) of six selected vegetation indices (Fig. 4). All VIs show that the spectral trajectories of the infested forest classes diverge from the healthy class i at some point in time and that the divergence is more significant than for most of the individual spectral bands (cf. Fig. 2, Fig. 4). The most overlaps between the spectral trajectories (i.e., overlaps of shaded areas in Fig. 4 representing the standard deviation within each class) are found for the REIP and TCG indices. Therefore, these two indices seem to be less suited for clear differentiation of the infestation classes and early detection than are the other three NDVI indices and TCW. Fig. 4 further shows that the NDVI 819/1649 and TCW clearly separate the class ii (red-attack in summer 2018) from class i at DOY 221 and that there is a notable difference change in the two trajectories since the beginning of the vegetation season. NDVI 550/650, NDVI 800/650, and TCG are able to separate these two classes later in the season (from DOY 231), followed by REIP (at DOY 241). Class iii (red-attack in autumn 2018) is separated from class i by NDVI 819/1649 and TCW first (at DOY 256), then by NDVI 550/650 and NDVI 800/650 (at DOY 261), and finally by TCG and REIP (at DOY 291). Although none of the vegetation indices could clearly separate the latest infestation class iv (red-attack in summer 2019) from class i, the most promising in this respect seem to be NDVI 819/1649 and TCW, for which the mean trajectories began to diverge from DOY 286. Fig. 5 provides further detail in spectral trajectories of TCW and combines it with pixel colour derived from a true colour image (TCI). The spectral trajectories of TCW always respond to an infestation earlier than do visually notable browning derived from TCI due to lower sensitivity of visible bands (especially for blue - B2 and green – B3 bands) to progressing infestation symptoms (see Fig. 2). Coloured dots referring to a pixel colour for instance do not give an evidence of green-attack stage presence at DOYs 286, 291, and 321 in class iv as the colour of the dots is still green, but TCW values are already decreasing).  

**3.3. Selection of important spectral bands and indices**  
An RF algorithm based on the TreeBagger function, was used to evaluate the importance of spectral bands and indices for early detection. Capability for early detection (i.e., separability between class i and class iv) was analysed for DOYs 286, 291, and 321, which were days displaying statistically significant differences as determined by the Mann–Whitney U test (p = 0.05) (Fig. 2). The predictor importance of Sentinel-2 bands for DOY 291 is shown in Fig. 6 (with overall classification accuracy of 87%). The most important contribution of individual spectral bands for discriminating between healthy and newly infested trees comes from B12 (SWIR band at the central wavelength 2190 nm). Lower importance of the other SWIR band B11 (central wavelength 1610 nm) may be due to its strong intercorrelation with B12. Other prospective bands for early detection of infestation were situated in the blue region (B2), in the red wavelength (chlorophyll absorption region sampled by B4), red-edge (B5 and B6), despite the fact that spectral trajectories of B6 for infestation classes were overlapping (see Fig. 4) and blue (B2). Consistent results were obtained also for other DOYs, confirming the B12, B2, B4, B5, and B6 bands as most suitable for early detection of infestation (see Fig. S1 in the online supplementary materials). The importance of vegetation indices was evaluated in a similar manner. Results for discriminating between healthy (class i) and newly infested trees (class iv) by means of the absolute and seasonal change in index value for DOY 291 are shown in Fig. 7. The result clearly demonstrates the importance of evaluating seasonal changes in VIs as compared to using static absolute index values. The classification accuracy evaluated for the tested data set of the seasonal change values was 96%, whereas 87% classification accuracy was achieved with the absolute index values. The highest importance for the seasonal change was observed in TCW, NDVI 800/650, and NDVI 819/1649 (at DOY 291), and this was consistent also for other tested DOYs (i.e., 286 and 321, see Fig. S2 in the online supplementary materials). Fig. 8. provides deeper insight into the temporal separability between healthy (class i) and two infested forest classes (iii and iv) during the vegetation season. It shows the classification accuracy of the RF algorithm applied to two testing data subsets: the first separating class i from class iii and the second separating class i from class iv for each Sentinel-2 acquisition since DOY 151. It confirms the relevance of assessing the seasonal changes of VIs for early bark beetle detection as the accuracy increases over time for both data sets. Meanwhile, classification accuracy based on absolute index values remained nearly constant throughout the season.  

**3.4. Model application and validation**  
Seasonal changes in TCW from classes i, iii, and iv on DOY 291 were used to train the final RF model. The classification result was applied per-pixel on Sentinel-2 cloud-free image synthesis generated from the end of the 2019 growing season using Google Earth Engine. Norway spruce forest stands of the Vysočina Region were classified into three classes (healthy, green-attack, and red-attack pixels) and Fig. 9 shows the map for one of the areas with concentrated field validation points. The classification results were verified on 80 plots focusing primarily on differentiating the early infested trees from healthy ones (40 green-attack and 40 healthy plots) distributed in all forest age categories (20 years and older), which were inspected in the field during the 2019/2020 winter season. Although the red-attack stands were classified. during the field surveys we aimed to visit as many validation plots for the healthy and green-attack stage classes that can be often confused and validation data for the visually obvious red-attack class were not primarily collected. Therefore, only about 15 stands in the red-attack stage were inspected. The overall classification accuracy of the early infested trees (green-attack) was 78% and details of the classification assessment are summarized in Table 3. Out of 40 plots classified as healthy, the field observation confirmed 32 sites to have no evidence of bark beetle presence or other forest damage symptoms and 8 plots with early infestation symptoms (i.e., already in green-attack stage) on the scale of individual trees covering an area smaller than a single Sentinel-2 pixel (20 × 20 m). From 40 sites classified as green-attack stage, 30 showed clear presence of bark beetle infestation (bark beetle holes and dry dust on stems or first symptoms of needle discoloration at the bottom of tree crowns). Seven sites were incorrectly classified due to concurrence of other factors, such as presence of small clear-cuts or of a few windfallen or dead trees without evident bark beetle damage. At the scale of individual trees or of areas smaller than the pixel size of Sentinel-2, it appears that these factors can easily be confused with the spectral response of bark beetle infestation symptoms. The remaining three sites that were misclassified showed neither bark beetle nor other forest damage symptoms.  

**3. 结果**  
**3.1. Sentinel-2光谱波段**  
使用Sentinel-2密集时间序列观测数据对树皮甲虫侵染下的森林发展进行了分析。我们获取了2018年4月初至11月底的14幅Sentinel-2影像。由于雪、云层和云阴影的存在，适合的观测数量受到限制，例如从6月30日至8月6日的数据存在一个月的缺失。  
在第一步中，我们评估了每个Sentinel-2波段在检测树皮甲虫侵染早期阶段的潜力。图2展示了每个波段的光谱轨迹（均值和标准差），图3展示了在DOY 126和291时每个类别的光谱反射率。根据图2，健康类别和侵染类别之间的分离潜力最高的波段是B4（红波段）、B5（红边波段）以及B11和B12（短波红外波段）。其他两个可见光波段B2（蓝波段）和B3（绿波段），以及B6、B7（红边波段）和B8a（近红外波段）在本研究中似乎对侵染检测最不敏感。总体而言，所有光谱轨迹在植被季节开始时都表现出冠层反射率的增加，并在DOY 151（5月底）达到峰值，这在可见光波段中尤为显著。这可能是由于当年新梢的萌发以及林下植被的发展及其对整体冠层信号的贡献。季节期间反射率的变化（在蓝波段B2中最为明显）可以部分归因于大气校正的不完善。  

**3.2. 植被指数**  
在第二步中，我们检查了六种选定植被指数的光谱轨迹（均值和标准差）（图4）。所有植被指数显示，受侵染森林类别的光谱轨迹在某个时间点与健康类别i分离，且这种分离比大多数单个光谱波段更为显著（参见图2和图4）。光谱轨迹之间的重叠最多（即图4中阴影区域的重叠，代表每个类别内的标准差）出现在REIP和TCG指数中。因此，这两个指数似乎比其他三种NDVI指数和TCW指数更不适合清晰区分侵染类别和早期检测。图4进一步显示，NDVI 819/1649和TCW在DOY 221时清晰地将类别ii（2018年夏季红攻击）与类别i分离，并且自植被季节开始以来，两条轨迹之间存在显著差异。NDVI 550/650、NDVI 800/650和TCG能够在季节后期（从DOY 231开始）分离这两个类别，随后是REIP（在DOY 241）。类别iii（2018年秋季红攻击）首先由NDVI 819/1649和TCW在DOY 256时与类别i分离，随后由NDVI 550/650和NDVI 800/650在DOY 261时分离，最后由TCG和REIP在DOY 291时分离。尽管没有植被指数能够清晰地将最新的侵染类别iv（2019年夏季红攻击）与类别i分离，但在这一方面最有潜力的似乎是NDVI 819/1649和TCW，其平均轨迹从DOY 286开始分离。图5提供了TCW光谱轨迹的更多细节，并将其与真彩色图像（TCI）的像素颜色相结合。TCW的光谱轨迹总是比TCI中视觉上明显的褐变更早响应侵染，这是由于可见光波段（尤其是蓝波段B2和绿波段B3）对侵染症状进展的敏感性较低（见图2）。例如，在类别iv中，DOYs 286、291和321时，像素颜色的彩色点并未显示绿攻击阶段的存在，因为点的颜色仍然是绿色，但TCW值已经开始下降。  

**3.3. 重要光谱波段和指数的选择**  
基于TreeBagger函数的RF算法用于评估光谱波段和指数在早期检测中的重要性。早期检测能力（即类别i和类别iv之间的可分性）在DOYs 286、291和321进行了分析，这些日期通过Mann-Whitney U检验（p = 0.05）显示出统计显著差异（图2）。DOY 291时Sentinel-2波段的预测重要性如图6所示（总体分类准确率为87%）。区分健康和新受侵染树木的最重要贡献来自B12（中心波长为2190 nm的短波红外波段）。另一个短波红外波段B11（中心波长为1610 nm）的重要性较低，可能是由于它与B12的强相关性。其他用于早期检测侵染的潜在波段位于蓝光区域（B2）、红光波长（B4采样的叶绿素吸收区域）、红边（B5和B6），尽管B6的光谱轨迹在侵染类别中重叠（见图4）以及蓝光（B2）。其他DOYs的结果也一致，确认B12、B2、B4、B5和B6波段最适合早期检测侵染（见在线补充材料中的图S1）。植被指数的重要性以类似的方式评估。通过绝对值和季节性变化值在DOY 291时区分健康（类别i）和新受侵染树木（类别iv）的结果如图7所示。结果清楚地表明，评估植被指数的季节性变化比使用静态绝对值更为重要。季节性变化值的测试数据集分类准确率为96%，而绝对值指数的分类准确率为87%。季节性变化中最重要的指数是TCW、NDVI 800/650和NDVI 819/1649（在DOY 291时），这在其他测试DOYs（即286和321，见在线补充材料中的图S2）中也一致。图8提供了健康（类别i）和两个受侵染森林类别（iii和iv）在植被季节期间时间可分性的更深入洞察。它显示了RF算法应用于两个测试数据子集的分类准确率：第一个子集从DOY 151开始分离类别i和类别iii，第二个子集分离类别i和类别iv。它证实了评估植被指数季节性变化对早期树皮甲虫检测的相关性，因为两个数据集的准确率随时间增加。与此同时，基于绝对值指数的分类准确率在整个季节中几乎保持不变。  

**3.4. 模型应用与验证**  
使用DOY 291时类别i、iii和iv的TCW季节性变化训练了最终的RF模型。分类结果应用于2019年生长季末期生成的Sentinel-2无云影像合成图，使用Google Earth Engine进行逐像素分类。Vysočina地区的挪威云杉林被分为三类（健康、绿攻击和红攻击像素），图9展示了其中一个区域的分类图，该区域集中了实地验证点。分类结果在80个样地上进行了验证，主要集中在区分早期受侵染树木和健康树木（40个绿攻击样地和40个健康样地），这些样地分布在所有林龄类别（20年及以上）中，并在2019/2020年冬季进行了实地检查。尽管红攻击林分也被分类，但在实地调查中，我们主要访问了健康和绿攻击阶段的验证样地，这些类别经常容易混淆，而视觉上明显的红攻击类别的验证数据并未主要收集。因此，仅检查了约15个红攻击阶段的林分。早期受侵染树木（绿攻击）的总体分类准确率为78%，分类评估的详细信息总结在表3中。在40个被分类为健康的样地中，实地观察确认32个样地没有树皮甲虫存在或其他森林损害症状，8个样地在单个树木尺度上显示出早期侵染症状（即已处于绿攻击阶段），覆盖面积小于单个Sentinel-2像素（20 × 20米）。在40个被分类为绿攻击阶段的样地中，30个显示出明显的树皮甲虫侵染迹象（树干上的树皮甲虫孔洞和干燥的木屑，或树冠底部针叶变色的初步症状）。7个样地由于其他因素的干扰而被错误分类，例如存在小面积皆伐或几棵风倒或枯死的树木，但没有明显的树皮甲虫损害。在单个树木或小于Sentinel-2像素大小的区域尺度上，这些因素很容易与树皮甲虫侵染症状的光谱响应混淆。其余三个被错误分类的样地既没有树皮甲虫也没有其他森林损害症状。

## 4. Discussion

**4.1. Definition of infestation stages and selection of classes**  
Based on seasonal trajectories of TCW for instance, we could assume that our class ii (red-attack stage in summer 2018) likely combines trees attacked in the previous year (probably present as a few individual trees with visual decay symptoms within a single Sentinel-2 pixel), as well as newly infested trees by the first bark beetle generation, which accelerates the forest decline process that is detectable at the spatial extent of a Sentinel-2 pixel. Class iii infested stands (red-attack in autumn 2018) likely corresponds to infested trees by the second generation of bark beetles (typically swarming in June/July). Favourable weather conditions of last years supported the development of the third generation of bark beetles and class iv might therefore correspond to stands infested by this last generation (however, it might include trees infested by the second generation of sister broods too).  
For the purposes of proactive forest management and mitigation of further spread of bark beetles, probably the most important infestation category to detect is class iv, which allows timely identification of those forest stands that were infested (i.e., green-attack) in the current vegetation season, will likely host beetles during the winter, and undergo decline in the following vegetation season (this class is spectrally separable after DOY 286). Proper detection of infested trees at the end of vegetation season (class iv) gives forest managers sufficient time frame (5–6 months) to plan salvage loggings before the emergence of new generation in the spring. Detection of infested stand in class ii or iii provides effectively 1–2 months only to execute salvage logging and sanitation before next generation of beetles leave their host trees.  

**4.2. Quality of Sentinel-2 observations**  
In this study, we evaluated the applicability of Sentinel-2 seasonal trajectories for early detection of bark beetle infestation. The final classification model was designed using time series of 2018 Sentinel-2 observations, but applied and validated on autumn 2019 data. The availability of high quality (i.e. cloud-free) Sentinel-2 images is an important prerequisite for successful assessment of bark beetle activity, as it varies in both space and time. Frequent cloud coverage in spring and autumn months, particularly in the mountainous areas, can cause considerable gaps in the time series analysis. In our case, a one-month gap was obtained in July, resulting in difficult early detection of class iii (stands experiencing green- and red-attack stages within the same year). To increase the probability of obtaining high-quality observations to reduce gaps in the time series or produce a cloud free mosaics for large-scale (national) mapping, a harmonized Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 product (Claverie et al., 2018) may be used to improve temporal resolution of the data at the cost of reducing red-edge spectral channels.  

**4.3. Spectral bands and vegetation indices**  
Exploration of seasonal trajectories of individual bands and their use for discrimination between infestation classes pointed mainly to the red, red-edge and SWIR bands as the most promising (Fig. 2, Fig. 6). Red Band 4 (central wavelength 665 nm) is located within the absorption region of chlorophylls, and the nearby red-edge band B5 (central wavelength of 705 nm) is also sensitive to leaf pigment changes, as well as canopy structure. The other two relevant bands, B11 (central wavelength 1610 nm) and B12 (central wavelength 2190 nm), are located in the SWIR region that mainly reflects changes in leaf water content and canopy structure (Kokaly et al., 2009, Ustin et al., 2004). This result is in line with other studies, where red-edge and SWIR spectral regions were also identified as important for early detection of bark beetles, for example by Foster et al., 2017, Abdullah et al., 2018, 2019b). In this study, NIR bands seemed less appropriate for early bark beetle detection, despite the recent evidence from Abdulah et al. (2018) pointing to significant differences in NIR leaf-level spectra between healthy and infested trees. The reason for poor performance of NIR bands from top-of-canopy observations compared to leaf-level measurement may be due to structural effects of forest canopies on the observed spectra.  
Spectral trajectories of vegetation indices (Fig. 4) separated infestation classes more clearly than most of the individual spectral bands (cf. Fig. 2, Fig. 4). The most sensitive indices are those employing spectral bands red (B4), red-edge (B5) and SWIR (B11, B12) that were identified as sensitive to progressing infestation. Clear separation of the infestation class ii occurs at DOY 221 (beginning of August) for TCW and NDVI891/1649 indices, which is later than reported by Abdullah et al. (2019b), who analysed seasonal spectral trajectories of vegetation indices computed from RapidEye and SPOT-5 data and detected spectral separation between healthy and newly infested stands already at the beginning of July. It is almost 1,5 months earlier than in our study, which could be partly attributed to a one-month gap in our time series in July and partly to different environmental conditions between sites and years, which might cause shifts in the timing of the first infestation.  

**4.4. Field validation**  
The proposed model utilizing the seasonal change of TCW was applied on Sentinel-2 image composed from autumn 2019 available observations to produce classification map of healthy, green- and red-attack forest stands. This map was validated by field observations, resulting in the classification accuracy between healthy and green-attack classes of 78%. The overall accuracy was greater than that found by Abdulah et al. (2018), who reported green-attack classification accuracy of 67% from Sentinel-2 and only 36% for Landsat-8. Our result was still higher than user and producer accuracies (57 – 70%) for detection of green-attack and early infestation classes from a single airborne hyperspectral observation for Bavarian forest that were reported by Fassnacht et al. (2014). Comparable accuracies (70 – 76%) were reported by Immitzer and Atzberger (2014) for classification of green-attack spruce trees from WorldView-2 data. However, all studies point to large confusion in classification of green-attack (or early infestation) from healthy trees and obviously these accuracies are lower than for classification of tree mortality or red-attack stages, where accuracies often reaches > 90% (e.g., Meddens et al., 2013, Fassnacht et al., 2014).  
Our experience from the field inspections shows that change in needle colour from green to yellow/red starts from the lower crown parts and progresses towards the tree tops, which were affected last (Fig. 10), although this do not correspond with observations by Wulder et al. (2006), who studied the impact of mountain bark beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in western North America and reported the first visible colour changes in tree tops. In the orthographic projection from a vertical plane (above an object), foliage discoloration and defoliation in the lower crown parts observed in Norway spruce are obscured by green tree tops, which makes early detection of bark beetle infestation by means of remote sensing observations even more challenging.  

**4.5. Applicability and limitations**  
The algorithm has been developed using seasonal trajectories constructed from a single vegetation season (2018), therefore it reflects the specific conditions of that year. The algorithm shall be further evaluated and re-calibrated using Sentinel-2 data from following seasons (different conditions, different number of images available etc.). Also, it has been developed for fully forested pixels and tested on Norway spruce monoculture stands rather than on forest mixtures. Its ability to detect early infestations is therefore reduced for mixed pixels and at the forest edges. According to Meddens et al. (2013), the accuracy of infestation detection rapidly diminishes with the decreasing number of infested trees within a mixed pixel. To assess the spectral mixture effects, one can analyse high spatial resolution data (unmanned aerial system or airborne) together with data from a medium-resolution satellite for selected forest plots. Alternatively, advanced 3D radiative transfer models (e.g., the DART model; Gastellu-Etchegorry et al., 2017) can be used for sensitivity analysis of forest reflectance to the mixture of trees under different infestation stages by modelling the different fractions of infested trees and upscaling of the signal from individual crowns into whole-canopy reflectance as observed by satellite instruments.  
The algorithm developed in this study utilizes seasonal changes built upon contrast between two time points within a single vegetation season and omits the long-term trends. Bark beetles may induce both rapid forest health decay and loss in a short period (when the population size is large) or lead to a chronic decrease in forest vigour (when the population size is moderate) (Meigs et al., 2011). Considering, that higher summer temperatures and precipitation deficits were common during the past several years in Central Europe, it is becoming more likely that the current bark beetle outbreaks occur as abrupt changes. Rapid development of cloud computing tools with easy access to the extensive archive of Earth observation data collections will allow moving beyond traditional static, single-day image analysis to complex analyses of short-term (seasonal trajectories as presented in this study) together with long-term (several years) trends in forest health status.  

**4. 讨论**  
**4.1. 侵染阶段的定义与类别选择**  
基于TCW的季节性轨迹，我们可以假设我们的类别ii（2018年夏季的红攻击阶段）可能结合了前一年受侵染的树木（可能表现为单个Sentinel-2像素内少数具有视觉衰退症状的树木）以及第一代树皮甲虫新侵染的树木，这加速了森林衰退过程，并在Sentinel-2像素的空间范围内可检测到。类别iii的受侵染林分（2018年秋季的红攻击）可能对应于第二代树皮甲虫侵染的树木（通常在6月/7月群飞）。过去几年的有利天气条件支持了第三代树皮甲虫的发展，因此类别iv可能对应于受这一代侵染的林分（然而，它可能也包括受第二代姐妹群侵染的树木）。  
为了主动森林管理和减缓树皮甲虫的进一步扩散，可能最重要的侵染类别是类别iv，它允许及时识别在当前植被季节受侵染（即绿攻击）的林分，这些林分可能在冬季寄宿甲虫，并在接下来的植被季节经历衰退（该类在DOY 286后光谱上可分离）。在植被季节末期正确检测受侵染树木（类别iv）为森林管理者提供了足够的时间框架（5-6个月）以在春季新一代甲虫出现之前计划抢救性采伐。检测类别ii或iii的受侵染林分仅提供了1-2个月的时间来执行抢救性采伐和清理，然后下一代甲虫离开其寄主树木。  

**4.2. Sentinel-2观测的质量**  
在本研究中，我们评估了Sentinel-2季节性轨迹在早期检测树皮甲虫侵染中的适用性。最终的分类模型使用2018年Sentinel-2观测时间序列设计，但应用于2019年秋季数据并进行了验证。高质量（即无云）Sentinel-2影像的可用性是成功评估树皮甲虫活动的重要前提，因为它在空间和时间上都有所变化。春季和秋季频繁的云覆盖，特别是在山区，可能导致时间序列分析中的显著缺失。在我们的案例中，7月出现了一个月的缺失，导致难以早期检测类别iii（在同一植被季节内经历绿攻击和红攻击阶段的林分）。为了提高获取高质量观测的概率以减少时间序列中的缺失或生成大规模（全国）无云镶嵌图，可以使用Sentinel-2和Landsat 8的协调产品（Claverie等，2018），以提高数据的时间分辨率，但代价是减少红边光谱通道。  

**4.3. 光谱波段与植被指数**  
对各波段季节性轨迹的探索及其在区分侵染类别中的应用主要指向红波段、红边波段和短波红外波段（图2，图6）。红波段4（中心波长665 nm）位于叶绿素的吸收区域，附近的红边波段B5（中心波长705 nm）也对叶片色素变化和冠层结构敏感。另外两个相关波段B11（中心波长1610 nm）和B12（中心波长2190 nm）位于短波红外区域，主要反映叶片水分含量和冠层结构的变化（Kokaly等，2009；Ustin等，2004）。这一结果与其他研究一致，红边和短波红外光谱区域也被认为是早期检测树皮甲虫的重要区域，例如Foster等（2017）、Abdullah等（2018，2019b）。在本研究中，近红外波段似乎不太适合早期检测树皮甲虫，尽管Abdulah等（2018）最近的研究表明，健康树木和受侵染树木在近红外叶片光谱上存在显著差异。近红外波段在冠层顶部观测中的表现较差可能是由于森林冠层结构对观测光谱的影响。  
植被指数的光谱轨迹（图4）比大多数单个光谱波段更清晰地区分了侵染类别（参见图2，图4）。最敏感的指数是那些使用红波段（B4）、红边波段（B5）和短波红外波段（B11，B12）的指数，这些波段被确定对侵染进展敏感。侵染类别ii的清晰分离在DOY 221（8月初）由TCW和NDVI891/1649指数实现，这比Abdullah等（2019b）报告的要晚，他们分析了基于RapidEye和SPOT-5数据计算的植被指数的季节性光谱轨迹，并在7月初检测到健康和新受侵染林分之间的光谱分离。这比我们的研究早了近1.5个月，部分原因可能是我们7月时间序列中的一个月的缺失，部分原因是不同地点和年份的环境条件可能导致首次侵染时间的偏移。  

**4.4. 实地验证**  
利用TCW季节性变化的模型应用于2019年秋季的Sentinel-2影像，生成了健康、绿攻击和红攻击林分的分类图。该图通过实地观测进行了验证，健康和绿攻击类别之间的分类准确率为78%。总体准确率高于Abdulah等（2018）的研究，他们报告的Sentinel-2绿攻击分类准确率为67%，而Landsat-8仅为36%。我们的结果也高于Fassnacht等（2014）报告的巴伐利亚森林单次机载高光谱观测的绿攻击和早期侵染类别的用户和生产准确率（57-70%）。Immitzer和Atzberger（2014）报告的WorldView-2数据对绿攻击云杉树的分类准确率（70-76%）与我们的结果相当。然而，所有研究都指出，绿攻击（或早期侵染）与健康树木的分类存在较大混淆，显然这些准确率低于树木死亡或红攻击阶段的分类准确率，后者的准确率通常达到>90%（例如，Meddens等，2013；Fassnacht等，2014）。  
我们的实地检查经验表明，针叶颜色从绿色变为黄色/红色的变化从树冠下部开始，逐渐向树顶发展，树顶最后受到影响（图10），尽管这与Wulder等（2006）的研究结果不符，他们研究了北美西部的山松甲虫（Dendroctonus ponderosae）的影响，并报告了树顶首次出现可见的颜色变化。在垂直平面（物体上方）的正射投影中，挪威云杉树冠下部的叶片变色和落叶被绿色的树顶遮挡，这使得通过遥感观测早期检测树皮甲虫侵染更具挑战性。  

**4.5. 适用性与局限性**  
该算法是使用2018年单一植被季节的季节性轨迹开发的，因此它反映了该年的特定条件。该算法应使用后续季节的Sentinel-2数据（不同条件，不同数量的可用影像等）进一步评估和重新校准。此外，它是为完全森林覆盖的像素开发的，并在挪威云杉纯林中进行了测试，而不是在混合林中。因此，其在混合像素和森林边缘检测早期侵染的能力有所降低。根据Meddens等（2013）的研究，随着混合像素中受侵染树木数量的减少，侵染检测的准确率迅速下降。为了评估光谱混合效应，可以分析高空间分辨率数据（无人机系统或机载）与中分辨率卫星数据在选定森林样地上的结合。或者，可以使用先进的3D辐射传输模型（例如DART模型；Gastellu-Etchegorry等，2017）进行森林反射率对不同侵染阶段树木混合的敏感性分析，通过模拟受侵染树木的不同比例并将信号从单个树冠扩展到卫星仪器观测到的整个冠层反射率。  
本研究中开发的算法利用单一植被季节内两个时间点之间的对比构建的季节性变化，忽略了长期趋势。树皮甲虫可能在短时间内（当种群规模较大时）引发森林健康的快速衰退和损失，或在种群规模中等时导致森林活力的慢性下降（Meigs等，2011）。考虑到过去几年中欧夏季高温和降水不足的普遍性，当前的树皮甲虫爆发更可能是突然变化。云计算工具的快速发展以及轻松访问大量地球观测数据档案的能力，将使我们能够超越传统的静态单日影像分析，转向对森林健康状况的短期（如本研究中展示的季节性轨迹）和长期（几年）趋势的复杂分析。  

## 5. Conclusion

This study focused on early detection of bark beetle infestation in spruce monoculture stands of the Czech Republic by monitoring their spectral changes within a single vegetation season using dense time series of Sentinel-2 satellite observations. We followed the seasonal changes in forest canopy reflectance to identify the most sensitive spectral bands and vegetation indices for early detection of bark beetle infestation. The detection was based on a random forest algorithm that identified promising bands located in the SWIR (B12), red (B4), and red-edge (B5, B6) regions. The contribution of each band was evaluated based on absolute values for a specific DOY and their seasonal changes (utilizing a baseline DOY and an assessment DOY). For all studied vegetation indices, seasonal change of the VIs showed higher potential for identification of infested stands rather than their absolute value, the accuracy of classification based on seasonal change increased in time. From the vegetation indices, the most promising for early detection were the tasselled cap wetness component and normalized difference index combining NIR (B8a) and SWIR (B11) bands. A prediction model calibrated for the 2018 season using tasselled cap wetness component was applied in the 2019 vegetation season to predict the green-attack stage of recently infested forests. Results were validated against field observation of 80 plots located in different areas of bark beetle activity. Overall accuracy of 78% was achieved, with good separation between healthy and green-attack stages.  
This study highlights the importance of SWIR spectral bands for the early detection of bark beetle infestations, together with the use of multi-temporal remote sensing to study seasonal trajectories of forest canopies. Our findings show, that the temporal resolution and the ability of remote sensing system to track gradual changes in forest reflectance are more important for the early detection of the infestation than their spatial and spectral resolution. The combination of both the long-term trends (several seasons) with a seasonal trend of appropriate vegetation indices (TCW as suggested here) might offer an operational tool for large-scale monitoring and detection of infested stands and their timely removal, particularly during winter months.  

**5. 结论**  
本研究通过使用Sentinel-2卫星观测的密集时间序列监测捷克挪威云杉纯林在单一植被季节内的光谱变化，重点研究了树皮甲虫侵染的早期检测。我们追踪了森林冠层反射率的季节性变化，以确定对树皮甲虫侵染早期检测最敏感的光谱波段和植被指数。检测基于随机森林算法，该算法识别了位于短波红外（B12）、红波段（B4）和红边（B5，B6）区域的有前景的波段。每个波段的贡献基于特定DOY的绝对值及其季节性变化（利用基线DOY和评估DOY）进行评估。对于所有研究的植被指数，季节性变化比绝对值显示出更高的识别受侵染林分的潜力，基于季节性变化的分类准确率随时间增加。在植被指数中，最有前景的早期检测指数是帽状湿度分量和结合近红外（B8a）和短波红外（B11）波段的归一化差异指数。使用帽状湿度分量校准的2018季节预测模型应用于2019植被季节，以预测最近受侵染森林的绿攻击阶段。结果通过在树皮甲虫活动不同区域的80个样地的实地观测进行了验证。总体准确率达到78%，健康和绿攻击阶段之间的分离效果良好。  
本研究强调了短波红外光谱波段在树皮甲虫侵染早期检测中的重要性，以及使用多时相遥感研究森林冠层季节性轨迹的意义。我们的研究结果表明，遥感系统的时间分辨率及其追踪森林反射率逐渐变化的能力对于侵染的早期检测比其空间和光谱分辨率更为重要。将长期趋势（几个季节）与适当植被指数（如本文建议的TCW）的季节性趋势相结合，可能为大规模监测和检测受侵染林分及其及时移除（特别是在冬季）提供操作工具。
